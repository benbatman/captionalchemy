[MUSIC PLAYING]

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,481
The laws of physics are equations of motion. They

11
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:32,731
are mathematical rules that dictate how systems evolve in time.

12
00:00:32,831 --> 00:00:35,471
Newton's equations for classical mechanics, Maxwell's

13
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,291
equations for electrom ag net ism, and

14
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,591
the Sch rod inger equation for quantum mechanics. These

15
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:44,651
laws can be used to predict how the universe will evolve into the future

16
00:00:44,751 --> 00:00:47,231
. They are deter ministic. Perfect

17
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,381
knowledge of a system in the present, perfectly

18
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:52,691
predicts how the system will change in the next instant, and

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,141
the instant after that, add

20
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:58,461
inf init um. But determin ism in the forward time direction does

21
00:00:58,561 --> 00:01:02,541
not guarantee that the same laws can perfectly predict the

22
00:01:02,641 --> 00:01:05,931
past. And yet this sort of deter ministic symmetry, time

23
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,751
reversal symmetry, is

24
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:11,401
essential for information itself to be conserv ed.

[SILENCE]

26
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,203
Today, we learn why conservation of information is such a

27
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,293
fundamental requirement of quantum mechanics. In

28
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:20,923
a future episode, we'll

29
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:24,483
see how this law might be broken by black holes. An

30
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:28,603
important tool for making predictions with the laws of physics are the conservation laws

31
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:30,463
that we derive from them. As

32
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:31,883
we discussed recently, we

33
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:36,023
can use Notice The orem to discover quantities that are conserv ed in a system by

34
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,193
looking at the symm et ries of the equations of motion.

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,970
For example, if the equations stay the same from one point in time to the next, then

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,260
energy is conserv ed.

37
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,732
Notice theorem applies to smooth, continuous

38
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,142
symm et ries where we can transform the chosen coordinate, however

39
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,152
much we like without changing the system.

40
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:59,337
but there are also symm et ries under discrete transformations. They're

41
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,307
more like on / off switches. For

42
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:05,407
example, we could reverse all electric charges or we could flip the x- axis

43
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,547
by looking in a mirror or we could make time run backwards.

44
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,972
Sy mm etry in that last one, time

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,632
reversal symmetry, isn't

46
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,362
covered by notice theorem, but

47
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,732
it's still tied to a conservation law, the

48
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,342
conservation of information. We

49
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:23,552
say that a system is time reversal symm etric if its equations of motion allow

50
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:27,652
us to perfectly predict the starting point simply by knowing the state of

51
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,372
the system at any later time. If

52
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:33,542
they allow us to re wind the clock and figure out a single unique

53
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:34,592
history,

54
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:38,709
The entire universe would be time reversal symm etric if knowing the exact

55
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:43,309
state of every particle in the universe at one point in time allowed us to calculate

56
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,239
its exact past history at all times. That

57
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:50,719
would mean that the exact configuration of the universe at any point in time defines

58
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,769
the exact configuration at any other point.

59
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,547
For one thing, this

60
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:58,727
time reversal symmetry means complete information about the configuration at all

61
00:02:58,827 --> 00:03:00,847
prior times still exists, and

62
00:03:00,947 --> 00:03:04,427
always will, even if we can't practically access it.

63
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,879
That's what I mean about conservation of information.

64
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:11,436
A related idea is causal determin ism, the

65
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:15,616
idea that perfectly knowing the current state perfectly predicts all future

66
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:19,796
states. But this sort of future determin ism doesn't have to be time

67
00:03:19,896 --> 00:03:21,376
reversal symm etric. It's

68
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:25,386
possible for the future to be perfectly predictable by the laws of physics while the

69
00:03:25,486 --> 00:03:26,436
past is not.

70
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,770
For example, what if many different configurations of particles in the present could

71
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,100
converge on a single configuration of particles in the future?

72
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,925
If a multitude of states can all evolve into the same state, then

73
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:41,825
knowing the latter state isn't enough for us to figure out what past states led to it.

74
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:43,535
For example, imagine

75
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:44,955
you have two states, A

76
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:49,205
and B, and the laws of motion say that A becomes C and B

77
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:53,265
becomes D. If we look at the later state and C states C

78
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,205
, we know A came first, but

79
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,575
if we see state D, we

80
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,695
know B came first. But

81
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,375
what if both A and B lead to state C?

82
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:01,832
[SILENCE]

83
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,752
that future direction is deter ministic. But

84
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,502
now, if we look at the final state, we

85
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:10,892
see state c, but we don't know which of a or b led to it.

86
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:11,407
The

87
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,752
information about those past states would be lost.

88
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:14,942
Okay, so

89
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,342
it should be simple enough to erase information, right

90
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:21,432
? We just set things up so our laws of motion force two possible initial

91
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,772
states into the same exact final state. Then

92
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:27,152
we wouldn't know what the original state was, and

93
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,002
information would be destroyed.

94
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,773
Actually, quantum

95
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:32,803
mechanics forbids this. It

96
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:38,023
ensures conservation of information and time reversal symmetry because of an even more fundamental

97
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,883
rule. The conservation of probability.

To get at this, let's

100
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,825
think about the basic equation of motion of quantum mechanics. That's

101
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,795
the Sch rod inger equation. The

102
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:51,855
time- dependent Sch rod inger equation describes the time evolution of this

103
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,695
thing called the wave function. The

104
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:57,735
wave function of a system fully describes all of its properties, and

105
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,685
in quantum mechanics, that

106
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:02,885
means the probability distribution of all of its properties, which

107
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:05,505
you can get by taking the square of the wave function.

108
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:06,447
[SILENCE]

109
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,557
For example, the wave function of a particle encaps ulates the probability

110
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:14,597
that will be found in this or that location if we were to try to measure

111
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:18,607
its position. The Schr รถ d inger equation perfectly predicts both

112
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:23,397
the past and future evolution of a given wave function in any given environment

113
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,937
, or in quantum speak, in

114
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,447
any given potential.

115
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:27,465
In that sense, it's

116
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,495
deter ministic and time reversal symm etric, and

117
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,065
so conserv es information.

118
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:36,595
in principle, a given wave function in a given potential could mean

119
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:40,125
the wave function of an electron moving in an atom's electric field, or

120
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:44,535
it could mean the wave function of the entire universe in its own imp ossibly

121
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,645
complex and changing potential.

[SILENCE]

123
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:52,017
So, the Sch rod inger equation guarantees time revers ibility and so the conservation

124
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,237
of information, as

125
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:57,337
do the more advanced formulations of quantum mechanics like the Dir ac equation and quantum

126
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,387
field theories.

127
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:02,526
that guarantee arises from a really fundamental foundational quality

128
00:06:02,626 --> 00:06:03,976
of these theories. It

129
00:06:04,076 --> 00:06:06,686
comes from what we call unit arity. Remember

130
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:11,096
that the wave function encaps ulates the distribution of probabilities for a given property

131
00:06:11,196 --> 00:06:12,686
. By definition, those

132
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,526
probabilities should add up to one. That

133
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:19,756
just means there's a 100 % probability that any given property will have some

134
00:06:19,856 --> 00:06:21,106
possible value, even

135
00:06:21,206 --> 00:06:22,426
if that value is zero.

136
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:25,462
In the case of particle position, probability

137
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:29,022
of adding to one just means that the particle is definitely somewhere.

138
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,171
And as time goes on, a

139
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:35,191
particle's properties will continue to have possible values. The

140
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,691
probability should continue to sum to 1.

141
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,500
[SILENCE]

142
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,980
If this is true, and

143
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,360
it must be, we say that the time evolution of the wave function is unit

144
00:06:44,460 --> 00:06:48,380
ary. And this unit arity is a foundational assumption in all

145
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:51,520
formulations of quantum mechanics and quantum field theories.

146
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,396
Un iter ity is a non- neg ot iable statement about how probability works

147
00:06:56,496 --> 00:07:01,026
, but the condition also ensures time reversal symmetry and conservation of information

148
00:07:01,126 --> 00:07:02,076
.

149
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,340
It's not straightforward to explain without getting into some hairy math, but

150
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,790
the up shot is that quantum states must remain independent of each other

151
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,380
in order to preserve probability. Two

152
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,610
independent quantum states can't evolve into the exact same quantum

153
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,190
state. If they did then the probabilities for the initial states, or

154
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,940
for the final state can't both sum to one.

155
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,725
Back to our first example, quantum

156
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:29,225
states A and B can't both become quantum states C. The

157
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,645
sum of the probabilities prior to the merger would not equal the sum of the probabilities

158
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,595
after the merger and unit arity would be broken. The

159
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:42,085
only type of evolution that preserves probability and unit arity is the evolution

160
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:45,365
that also preserves the number of quantum states. And

161
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,495
the preservation of quantum states means preservation of information because you

162
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,545
can trace a quantum state indefinitely forwards and backwards in

163
00:07:53,645 --> 00:07:57,625
time. But all of this talk of quantum mechanics being deter ministic seems

164
00:07:57,725 --> 00:08:01,725
a bit at odds with the idea of quantum random ness and the uncertainty principle

165
00:08:01,825 --> 00:08:02,835
. After all, doesn't

166
00:08:02,935 --> 00:08:06,945
the act of measurement pick a single value of some quantity from the range

167
00:08:07,045 --> 00:08:08,535
of possible values? That

168
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:12,605
value seems to be chosen randomly based on the probability distribution

169
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,565
encoded in the wave function. And

170
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:18,755
the precision of the know ability of that value is defined by the uncertainty

171
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,895
principle. It sure seems like information can be lost.

172
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,915
but that's not really what we mean by quantum information. Quantum

173
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,945
information refers to the full information content of the wave function

174
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,845
, not just what we measure. And

175
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,005
in principle, make

176
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:37,225
enough measurements and you can extract all of the information from a wave function.

177
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:37,825
It's

178
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,705
worth mentioning that the collapse of the wave function in the Copenhagen interpretation

179
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:45,985
of quantum mechanics actually does mess with conservation of information

180
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:48,125
. According to that interpretation, the

181
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,345
active measurement actually alters the entire wave function, causing

182
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:56,655
it to shrink down to the narrow range of possible values implied by the

183
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,475
result of the measurement.

184
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:04,244
but that measured wave function can't then be tracked backwards to recover the passed wave function

185
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:09,484
. So this interpretation is neither deter ministic nor time reversal symm etric

186
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,534
.

187
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,165
Other interpretations of quantum mechanics, for

188
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:13,090
example, Everett's

189
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,455
many worlds or the de Bro gl ie- B ohm pilot wave theory, preserve

190
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,485
this time revers ibility. In

191
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:20,065
the case of many worlds, the

192
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,445
entire wave function continues to exist even after measurement.

193
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,270
That measurement itself is just a thing that happens in one part of the possibility space

194
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,160
, no information is really lost. And

195
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,950
in the case of pilot wave theory, the

196
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,340
wave function contains hidden information that is carried with the final measured

197
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,390
particle.

198
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,877
[SILENCE]

199
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:43,427
There is one situation where time revers ibility appears to be broken, regardless

200
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,457
of your favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's

201
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:50,417
the case of black holes and Hawking radiation. Stephen

202
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:55,267
Hawking's ep onymous radiation appears to destroy quantum information, leading

203
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,587
to the famous black hole information paradox. In

204
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,087
an upcoming episode, we'll

205
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:05,427
see where the quantum information really can be deleted from the otherwise perfect memory

206
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:06,477
of spac etime.
