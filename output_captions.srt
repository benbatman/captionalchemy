[MUSIC PLAYING]

10
00:00:25,491 --> 00:00:28,481
The laws of physics are equations of motion. They

11
00:00:28,581 --> 00:00:33,181
are mathematical rules that dictate how systems evolve intime. Newton's

12
00:00:33,281 --> 00:00:35,471
equations for classical mechanics, Maxwell's

13
00:00:35,571 --> 00:00:37,291
equations for electromagnetism, and

14
00:00:37,391 --> 00:00:40,591
the Sch rod inger equation for quantum mechanics. These

15
00:00:40,691 --> 00:00:45,231
laws can be used to predict how the universe will evolve into the future. They

16
00:00:45,331 --> 00:00:47,231
are deterministic. Perfect

17
00:00:47,331 --> 00:00:49,381
knowledge of a system in the present, perfectly

18
00:00:49,481 --> 00:00:52,691
predicts how the system will change in the next instant, and

19
00:00:52,791 --> 00:00:54,141
the instant after that, add

20
00:00:54,241 --> 00:00:59,851
infinitum. But determinism in the forward time direction does not guarantee

21
00:00:59,951 --> 00:01:03,321
that the same laws can perfectly predict the past. And

22
00:01:03,421 --> 00:01:05,931
yet this sort of deterministic symmetry, time

23
00:01:06,031 --> 00:01:07,751

24
00:01:07,851 --> 00:01:11,401
essential for information itself tobe conserved.

[SILENCE]

26
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:16,203
Today, we learn why conservation of information is such a

27
00:01:16,303 --> 00:01:19,293
fundamental requirement of quantum mechanics. In

28
00:01:19,393 --> 00:01:20,923
a future episode, we'll

29
00:01:21,023 --> 00:01:24,483
see how this law might be broken by black holes. An

30
00:01:24,583 --> 00:01:28,603
important tool for making predictions with the laws of physics are the conservation laws

31
00:01:28,703 --> 00:01:30,463
that we derive from them. As

32
00:01:30,563 --> 00:01:31,883
we discussed recently, we

33
00:01:31,983 --> 00:01:36,023
can use Notice Theorem to discover quantities that are conserved in a system by

34
00:01:36,123 --> 00:01:39,193
looking at the symmetries of the equations of motion.

35
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:43,970
For example, if the equations stay the same from one point intime to the next, then

36
00:01:44,070 --> 00:01:45,260
energy is conserved.

37
00:01:45,612 --> 00:01:48,732
Notice theorem applies to smooth, continuous

38
00:01:48,832 --> 00:01:52,142
symmetries where we can transform the chosen coordinate, however

39
00:01:52,242 --> 00:01:54,152
much we like without changing the system.

40
00:01:54,857 --> 00:01:59,337
but there are also symmetries under discrete transformations. They're

41
00:01:59,437 --> 00:02:01,307
more like on / off switches. For

42
00:02:01,407 --> 00:02:05,407
example, we could reverse all electric charges or we could flip the x- axis

43
00:02:05,507 --> 00:02:08,547
by looking in a mirror or we could make time run backwards.

44
00:02:09,292 --> 00:02:10,972
Symmetry in that last one, time

45
00:02:11,072 --> 00:02:12,632
reversal symmetry, isn't

46
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:14,362
covered by notice theorem, but

47
00:02:14,462 --> 00:02:16,732
it's still tied toa conservation law, the

48
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,342
conservation of information. We

49
00:02:19,442 --> 00:02:23,552
say that a system is time reversal symmetric if its equations of motion allow

50
00:02:23,652 --> 00:02:27,652
us to perfectly predict the starting point simply by knowing the state of

51
00:02:27,752 --> 00:02:29,372
the system at any later time. If

52
00:02:29,472 --> 00:02:33,542
they allow us tore wind the clock and figure out a single unique

53
00:02:33,642 --> 00:02:34,592
history,

54
00:02:34,369 --> 00:02:38,709
The entire universe would betime reversal symmetric if knowing the exact

55
00:02:38,809 --> 00:02:43,309
state of every particle in the universe atone point intime allowed us to calculate

56
00:02:43,409 --> 00:02:46,239
its exact past history at all times. That

57
00:02:46,339 --> 00:02:50,719
would mean that the exact configuration of the universe at any point intime defines

58
00:02:50,819 --> 00:02:52,769
the exact configuration at any other point.

59
00:02:53,537 --> 00:02:54,547
For one thing, this

60
00:02:54,647 --> 00:02:59,697
time reversal symmetry means complete information about the configuration at all prior times

61
00:02:59,797 --> 00:03:01,937
still exists, and always will, even

62
00:03:02,037 --> 00:03:04,427
if we can't practically accessit.

63
00:03:04,969 --> 00:03:07,879
That's what I mean about conservation of information.

64
00:03:08,426 --> 00:03:11,436
A related idea is causal determinism, the

65
00:03:11,536 --> 00:03:16,486
idea that perfectly knowing the current state perfectly predicts all future states. But

66
00:03:16,586 --> 00:03:21,376
this sort of future determinism doesn't have tobe time reversal symmetric. It's

67
00:03:21,476 --> 00:03:26,246
possible for the future tobe perfectly predictable by the laws of physics while the pastis not.

68
00:03:26,750 --> 00:03:30,770
For example, what if many different configurations of particles in the present could

69
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:34,100
converge ona single configuration of particles in the future?

70
00:03:34,575 --> 00:03:37,925
If a multitude of states can all evolve into the same state, then

71
00:03:38,025 --> 00:03:41,825
knowing the latter state isn't enough for us to figure out what past states led toit.

72
00:03:42,505 --> 00:03:43,535
For example, imagine

73
00:03:43,635 --> 00:03:44,955
you have two states, A

74
00:03:45,055 --> 00:03:49,205
and B, and the laws of motion say that A becomes Cand B

75
00:03:49,305 --> 00:03:53,265
becomes D. If we look at the later state and C states C

76
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:55,205
, we know A came first, but

77
00:03:55,305 --> 00:03:56,575
if we see stateD, we

78
00:03:56,675 --> 00:03:58,695
know B came first. But

79
00:03:58,795 --> 00:04:01,375
what if both A and B lead to state C?

80
00:04:01,275 --> 00:04:01,832
[SILENCE]

81
00:04:01,952 --> 00:04:04,752
that future direction is deterministic. But

82
00:04:04,852 --> 00:04:06,502
now, if we look at the final state, we

83
00:04:06,602 --> 00:04:10,892
see state c, but we don't know which of aor bled toit.

84
00:04:10,992 --> 00:04:11,407
The

85
00:04:11,507 --> 00:04:13,752
information about those past states would be lost.

86
00:04:14,322 --> 00:04:14,942
Okay, so

87
00:04:15,042 --> 00:04:17,342
it should be simple enough to erase information, right

88
00:04:17,442 --> 00:04:21,432
? We just set things up so our laws of motion force two possible initial

89
00:04:21,532 --> 00:04:24,772
states into the same exact final state. Then

90
00:04:24,872 --> 00:04:27,152
we wouldn't know what the original state was, and

91
00:04:27,252 --> 00:04:29,002
information would be destroyed.

92
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:30,773
Actually, quantum

93
00:04:30,873 --> 00:04:32,803
mechanics forbids this. It

94
00:04:32,903 --> 00:04:38,023
ensures conservation of information and time reversal symmetry because of an even more fundamental

95
00:04:38,123 --> 00:04:40,883
rule. The conservation of probability.

To get at this, let's

98
00:04:42,615 --> 00:04:45,825
think about the basic equation of motion of quantum mechanics. That's

99
00:04:45,925 --> 00:04:47,795
the Sch rod inger equation. The

100
00:04:47,895 --> 00:04:51,855
time- dependent Sch rod inger equation describes the time evolution of this

101
00:04:51,955 --> 00:04:53,695
thing called the wave function. The

102
00:04:53,795 --> 00:04:57,735
wave function of a system fully describes all of its properties, and

103
00:04:57,835 --> 00:04:59,685
in quantum mechanics, that

104
00:04:59,785 --> 00:05:02,885
means the probability distribution of all of its properties, which

105
00:05:02,985 --> 00:05:05,505
you can get by taking the square of the wave function.

106
00:05:05,907 --> 00:05:06,447
[SILENCE]

107
00:05:06,567 --> 00:05:10,557
For example, the wave function of a particle encapsulates the probability

108
00:05:10,657 --> 00:05:14,597
that will be found in this or that location if we were to try to measure

109
00:05:14,697 --> 00:05:18,607
its position. The Schr รถ dinger equation perfectly predicts both

110
00:05:18,707 --> 00:05:23,397
the past and future evolution of a given wave function in any given environment

111
00:05:23,497 --> 00:05:24,937
, or in quantum speak, in

112
00:05:25,037 --> 00:05:26,447
any given potential.

113
00:05:26,465 --> 00:05:27,465
In that sense, it's

114
00:05:27,565 --> 00:05:30,495
deterministic and time reversal symmetric, and

115
00:05:30,595 --> 00:05:32,065
so conserves information.

116
00:05:32,485 --> 00:05:36,595
in principle, a given wave function in a given potential could mean

117
00:05:36,695 --> 00:05:40,125
the wave function of an electron moving in an atom's electric field, or

118
00:05:40,225 --> 00:05:44,535
it could mean the wave function of the entire universe in its own impossibly

119
00:05:44,635 --> 00:05:46,645
complex and changing potential.

[SILENCE]

121
00:05:47,567 --> 00:05:52,017
So, the Sch rod inger equation guarantees time reversibility and so the conservation

122
00:05:52,117 --> 00:05:53,237
of information, as

123
00:05:53,337 --> 00:05:57,337
do the more advanced formulations of quantum mechanics like the Dir ac equation and quantum

124
00:05:57,437 --> 00:05:58,387
field theories.

125
00:05:58,506 --> 00:06:03,726
that guarantee arises from areally fundamental foundational quality of these theories

126
00:06:03,826 --> 00:06:06,686
. It comes from what we call unit arity. Remember

127
00:06:06,786 --> 00:06:11,296
that the wave function encapsulates the distribution of probabilities fora given property. By

128
00:06:11,396 --> 00:06:12,686
definition, those

129
00:06:12,786 --> 00:06:15,526
probabilities should add up to one. That

130
00:06:15,626 --> 00:06:20,686
just means there's a 100 % probability that any given property will have some possible value

131
00:06:20,786 --> 00:06:22,426
, even if that value is zero.

132
00:06:23,102 --> 00:06:25,462
In the case of particle position, probability

133
00:06:25,562 --> 00:06:29,022
of adding to one just means that the particle is definitely somewhere.

134
00:06:29,761 --> 00:06:31,171
And as time goes on, a

135
00:06:31,271 --> 00:06:35,191
particle's properties will continue to have possible values. The

136
00:06:35,291 --> 00:06:37,691
probability should continue to sum to 1.

137
00:06:37,875 --> 00:06:38,500
[SILENCE]

138
00:06:38,590 --> 00:06:39,980
If this is true, and

139
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,920
it must be, we say that the time evolution of the wave function is unitary

140
00:06:45,020 --> 00:06:49,010
. And this unit arity is a foundational assumption in all formulations

141
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:51,520
of quantum mechanics and quantum field theories.

142
00:06:52,066 --> 00:06:56,656
Uniter ity is anon- negotiable statement about how probability works, but

143
00:06:56,756 --> 00:07:01,086
the condition also ensures time reversal symmetry and conservation of information.

144
00:07:01,600 --> 00:07:05,340
It's not straightforward to explain without getting into some hairy math, but

145
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,790
the upshot is that quantum states must remain independent of each other

146
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:12,380
in order to preserve probability. Two

147
00:07:12,480 --> 00:07:16,610
independent quantum states can't evolve into the exact same quantum

148
00:07:16,710 --> 00:07:20,190
state. If they did then the probabilities for the initial states, or

149
00:07:20,290 --> 00:07:22,940
for the final state can't both sum to one.

150
00:07:23,855 --> 00:07:25,725
Back to our first example, quantum

151
00:07:25,825 --> 00:07:29,225
states A and B can't both become quantum states C. The

152
00:07:29,325 --> 00:07:33,645
sum of the probabilities prior to the merger would not equal the sum of the probabilities

153
00:07:33,745 --> 00:07:37,595
after the merger and unit arity would be broken. The

154
00:07:37,695 --> 00:07:42,085
only type of evolution that preserves probability and unit arity is the evolution

155
00:07:42,185 --> 00:07:45,365
that also preserves the number of quantum states. And

156
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:49,495
the preservation of quantum states means preservation of information because you

157
00:07:49,595 --> 00:07:53,905
can trace a quantum state indefinitely forwards and backwards intime

158
00:07:54,005 --> 00:07:58,025
. But all of this talk of quantum mechanics being deterministic seems abit at

159
00:07:58,125 --> 00:08:02,165
odds with the idea of quantum randomness and the uncertainty principle. After

160
00:08:02,265 --> 00:08:06,425
all, doesn't the act of measurement pick a single value of some quantity from

161
00:08:06,525 --> 00:08:08,535
the range of possible values? That

162
00:08:08,635 --> 00:08:12,605
value seems tobe chosen randomly based on the probability distribution

163
00:08:12,705 --> 00:08:14,565
encoded in the wave function. And

164
00:08:14,665 --> 00:08:18,755
the precision of the knowability of that value is defined by the uncertainty

165
00:08:18,855 --> 00:08:21,895
principle. It sure seems like information can be lost.

166
00:08:22,385 --> 00:08:25,915
but that's not really what we mean by quantum information. Quantum

167
00:08:26,015 --> 00:08:29,945
information refers to the full information content of the wave function

168
00:08:30,045 --> 00:08:31,845
, not just what we measure. And

169
00:08:31,945 --> 00:08:33,005
in principle, make

170
00:08:33,105 --> 00:08:37,225
enough measurements and you can extract all of the information from awave function.

171
00:08:37,325 --> 00:08:37,825
It's

172
00:08:37,925 --> 00:08:41,705
worth mentioning that the collapse of the wave function in the Copenhagen interpretation

173
00:08:41,805 --> 00:08:45,985
of quantum mechanics actually does mess with conservation of information

174
00:08:46,085 --> 00:08:48,125
. According to that interpretation, the

175
00:08:48,225 --> 00:08:52,345
active measurement actually alters the entire wave function, causing

176
00:08:52,445 --> 00:08:56,655
it to shrink down to the narrow range of possible values implied by the

177
00:08:56,755 --> 00:08:58,475
result of the measurement.

178
00:08:58,754 --> 00:09:04,244
but that measured wave function can't then be tracked backwards to recover the passed wave function

179
00:09:04,344 --> 00:09:09,484
. Sothis interpretation is neither deterministic nor time reversal symmetric

180
00:09:09,584 --> 00:09:10,534
.

181
00:09:10,005 --> 00:09:12,165
Other interpretations of quantum mechanics, for

182
00:09:12,265 --> 00:09:13,090
example, Everett's

183
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:16,455
many worlds or the de Bro gl ie- B ohm pilot wave theory, preserve

184
00:09:16,555 --> 00:09:18,485
this time reversibility. In

185
00:09:18,585 --> 00:09:20,065
the case of many worlds, the

186
00:09:20,165 --> 00:09:23,445
entire wave function continues to exist even after measurement.

187
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:28,270
That measurement itself is just athing that happens inone part of the possibility space

188
00:09:28,370 --> 00:09:31,160
, no information is really lost. And

189
00:09:31,260 --> 00:09:32,950
in the case of pilot wave theory, the

190
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:37,340
wave function contains hidden information that is carried with the final measured

191
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:38,390
particle.

192
00:09:37,881 --> 00:09:38,877
[SILENCE]

193
00:09:38,937 --> 00:09:43,427
There is one situation where time reversibility appears tobe broken, regardless

194
00:09:43,527 --> 00:09:46,457
of your favourite interpretation of quantum mechanics. That's

195
00:09:46,557 --> 00:09:50,417
the case of black holes and Hawking radiation. Stephen

196
00:09:50,517 --> 00:09:55,267
Hawking's eponymous radiation appears to destroy quantum information, leading

197
00:09:55,367 --> 00:09:58,587
to the famous black hole information paradox. In

198
00:09:58,687 --> 00:10:00,087
an upcoming episode, we'll

199
00:10:00,187 --> 00:10:05,427
see where the quantum information really can be deleted from the otherwise perfect memory

200
00:10:05,527 --> 00:10:06,477
of spacetime.
